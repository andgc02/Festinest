**Business Plan: Festinest - Social Music Festival Planner App (US Market)**

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

**Product:** Festinest is a mobile-first platform that helps users discover music festivals, build personalized artist schedules, and coordinate with friend groups. The app provides aggregated festival data, smart artist/event recommendations, and private group planning tools-all in one place.

**Target Market:** U.S.-based casual and hardcore music festival attendees aged 18-34.

**Key Features:**
- Festival discovery (filter by location, genre, dates, size)
- Personalized artist schedule builder
- Smart recommendations (artists + festivals)
- Private group planning with shared schedules, polls, chat
- Offline access for schedules and maps

**Monetization:**
- Affiliate ticket links (Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, etc.)
- Non-intrusive in-app ads (sponsored festivals, products)
- Optional premium tier (ad-free, early access, aesthetic perks)

**Launch Goal:** Android app MVP + Web app. iOS version (Expo Go for testing, full App Store version later).

---

### **2. Market Opportunity**

- 800+ festivals annually in the U.S.
- 54% of U.S. adults have attended a festival; highest engagement among ages 18-34
- Fragmented experience currently (siloed festival apps, spreadsheets, group chats)
- Direct competitors (Festival Dust, FestPlan, Woov) each cover a narrow slice

---

### **3. Key Differentiators**

- Unified festival database + planning in one app
- Emphasis on group coordination with **people you already know**
- Personalized AI recommendations (artists + festivals)
- Offline reliability (maps, schedule, chat)

---

### **4. Tech Stack**

**Frontend:**
- **React Native** with **Expo** for cross-platform mobile (Android/iOS)
- **Expo Go** for iOS internal testing (distribute via QR code)
- **Tailwind CSS** or native styles + component libraries for fast UI prototyping

**Backend:**
- **Firebase** (Authentication, Firestore DB, Cloud Functions, Push Notifications)
- **Node.js** for any server-side logic
- **Algolia** for fast festival/artist search + filters
- **Supabase** or **PostgreSQL** for structured data like festival metadata if needed

**Web App:**
- **Next.js** with shared codebase (Monorepo with Expo + Next.js)
- Responsive design to mimic mobile experience on desktop

**AI & Recommendations:**
- Spotify API + internal ML models (user preferences, artist similarity)
- Firebase Cloud Functions or AWS Lambda to run async recommendations

---

### **5. Development Phases & Timeline**

**MVP Scope (Android/Web):**
- Festival discovery with filters
- Personalized schedule builder
- Group creation + shared schedule view
- Minimal chat or voting tool
- Offline access (Expo SQLite or local storage)

**Phase 2:**
- Smart recs + Spotify integration
- Map overlays and logistics
- Push notifications + reminders
- Affiliate link tracking + analytics

**Phase 3:**
- iOS native publishing (after Apple dev license + Mac access)
- Admin dashboard for curating festivals (or crowdsource intake)
- Premium tier + ad placements

---

### **6. Directory & Workspace Structure**

**Base Folder:** `Festinest/`

```
Festinest/
+-- apps/
|   +-- mobile/ (React Native Expo app)
|   +-- web/ (Next.js web version)
+-- backend/
|   +-- functions/ (Firebase or Node cloud functions)
|   +-- db/ (schema, migration scripts if using SQL)
+-- assets/ (icons, splash, mockups)
+-- docs/
|   +-- BusinessPlan.md
|   +-- Roadmap.md
|   +-- Research.md
|   +-- PitchDeck.pptx
+-- tools/ (CLI tools, data scraping, sync scripts)
+-- .env, .gitignore, README.md
```

---

### **7. Testing & Distribution Plan**

**Android:**
- Use Expo for development and deploy an **APK or AAB build**
- Distribute via Firebase App Distribution, Google Drive, or even Play Console Internal Testing

**iOS:**
- Build with Expo Go for now and distribute via Expo QR code
- Later: use **EAS Build + TestFlight** once you have Mac access and Apple dev account
- If Macless: Consider cloud CI like **EAS Build Cloud** or **Codemagic** to generate iOS builds

**Web App:**
- Host on **Vercel** or **Firebase Hosting**
- Share with early testers who don't want to install apps

---

### **8. Revenue Model (Year 1-2)**

- **Affiliate Ticket Links:** primary source during MVP (~$0.50-$3 per ticket)
- **Ad Revenue:** sponsored event placement ($50-$200 per festival)
- **Premium Tier:** $1.99/month or $9.99/year (target 3-5% conversion)

---

### **9. Risk & Mitigation**

- **App fatigue** (users don't want another app): mitigate by making it essential for group coordination
- **Apple dev/publishing barriers:** delay full launch, focus on Android/web to start
- **Festival data maintenance:** automate + allow user submissions with moderation

---

### **10. Next Steps**

1. Build out `Festinest` directory and base Expo mobile app
2. Implement MVP features (discovery, schedule, group view)
3. Distribute Android APK for feedback
4. Launch Web version for easier testing
5. Revisit business model + outreach to potential affiliate partners
